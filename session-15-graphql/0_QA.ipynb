    "### **What is GraphQL and how does it differ from REST? What problems does it solve?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- GraphQL is a **query language for APIs** that allows clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request.\n",
    "- Compared to REST, which exposes multiple endpoints with fixed response shapes, GraphQL exposes **one endpoint** and lets the **client shape the response**, so no over-fetching.\n",
    "\n",
    "It solves problems like    \n",
    "- over-fetching (getting more data than needed), - under-fetching (needing multiple requests to assemble one page), and \n",
    "- tight coupling between frontend and backend response formats.\n",

    "### **What is the N+1 query problem in GraphQL and how can it be resolved?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The N+1 problem happens when a resolver **fetches a parent list (1 query), then fires another query for each child item (N additional queries)**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This usually occurs when resolving nested fields like users -> posts.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The common solution is **using a DataLoader or batch loading approach**, which batches keys together and performs a single aggregated query (turning N queries into 1)."

    "### **Describe the difference between nullable and non-nullable fields in GraphQL. How do you denote them in the schema?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nullable fields: The field may return null.\n",
    "- Non-nullable fields: Must return a value; returning null results in an error bubbling up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In GraphQL schemas:\n",
    "- Nullable: email: String\n",
    "- Non-nullable: email: String!\n",

    "### **What is the DataLoader pattern and why is it important for GraphQL performance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "DataLoader **batches and caches data** fetching operations during query execution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important because it:\n",
    "- Eliminates **N+1** queries by batching\n",
    "- Deduplicates repeated fetches **within a single request**\n",
    "- Improves database/remote API **efficiency**\n",
    "\n",

    "Fragments are **reusable units of field selections**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You use them when:   \n",
    "- Multiple queries share the same set of fields\n",
    "- You want to avoid duplication\n",
    "- You want consistent field structures across queries\n",
    "\n",
    "They also help reduce client code duplication and improve maintainability."

    "- Returning partial data when appropriate (GraphQL supports this)\n",
