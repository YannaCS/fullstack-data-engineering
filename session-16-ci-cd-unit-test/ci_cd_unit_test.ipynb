    "### What is CI/CD?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of automatically building and testing code changes as they're committed to version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous Deployment (CD)** is the practice of automatically deploying code that passes all tests to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "- **Early bug detection**: Automated tests catch issues before they reach production\n",
    "- **Faster release cycles**: Automation reduces manual deployment time\n",
    "- **Improved code quality**: Consistent testing and quality checks\n",
    "- **Reduced risk**: Small, frequent changes are easier to troubleshoot\n",
    "- **Team collaboration**: Shared standards and automated workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### CI/CD Pipeline Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Source**: Code committed to version control (Git)\n",
    "2. **Build**: Code compiled and dependencies installed\n",
    "3. **Test**: Automated tests run (unit, integration, end-to-end)\n",
    "4. **Deploy**: Code deployed to staging/production environments\n",
    "5. **Monitor**: Track application performance and errors\n",

    "## GitHub Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform integrated directly into GitHub repositories. It automates workflows based on repository events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflows\n",
    "- YAML files stored in `.github/workflows/`\n",
    "- Define automated processes triggered by events\n",
    "- Can run on different operating systems (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Events (Triggers)\n",
    "- `push`: Code pushed to repository\n",
    "- `pull_request`: PR opened, synchronized, or reopened\n",
    "- `schedule`: Cron-based scheduling\n",
    "- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger\n",
    "- `release`: New release created\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jobs\n",
    "- Independent tasks that run in parallel (by default)\n",
    "- Each job runs on a fresh virtual machine (runner)\n",
    "- Can be configured to run sequentially using `needs`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "- Individual tasks within a job\n",
    "- Can run commands or use actions\n",
    "- Execute sequentially within a job\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actions\n",
    "- Reusable units of code\n",
    "- Can be from GitHub Marketplace or custom\n",

    "## Deployment Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Blue-Green Deployment\n",
    "- Maintain two identical production environments (Blue and Green)\n",
    "- Deploy new version to inactive environment\n",
    "- Switch traffic after validation\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Instant rollback, zero downtime\n",
    "- **Disadvantage**: Requires double infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Rolling Deployment\n",
    "- Gradually replace instances with new version\n",
    "- Update servers one-by-one or in batches\n",
    "- **Advantage**: No extra infrastructure needed\n",
    "- **Disadvantage**: Mixed versions during deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Canary Deployment\n",
    "- Deploy to small subset of users first\n",
    "- Monitor metrics before full rollout\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Risk mitigation, early feedback\n",
    "- **Disadvantage**: Complex routing and monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Feature Flags\n",
    "- Deploy code with features disabled\n",
    "- Enable features for specific users/groups\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Decouple deployment from release\n",
    "- **Disadvantage**: Code complexity increases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-Deployment**\n",
    "- [ ] All tests pass\n",
    "- [ ] Code review completed\n",
    "- [ ] Database migrations tested\n",
    "- [ ] Configuration updated\n",
    "- [ ] Rollback plan documented\n",
    "\n",
    "**During Deployment**\n",
    "- [ ] Monitor error rates\n",

    "### Unit Tests\n",
    "- Test individual functions/methods in isolation\n",
    "- Use mocking to isolate dependencies\n",
    "- Fast execution, high coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example from project:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_utils.py\n",

    "    # Assert\n",
    "    assert result == expected\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration Tests\n",
    "- Test interaction between components\n",
    "- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases)\n",
    "- Verify data flow between layers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example from project:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_services.py\n",
    "def test_get_weather(self, service, mock_db, mock_api_client):\n",

    "    mock_db.add.assert_called_once()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### End-to-End Tests\n",
    "- Test complete user flows\n",
    "- Use real or staging environments\n",
    "- Verify system behavior from user perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example from project:**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "### Mocking Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Mock:**\n",
    "- External API calls (WeatherAPIClient)\n",
    "- Database connections\n",
    "- File system operations\n",
    "- Time-dependent functions\n",
    "- Expensive computations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mocking Strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Mock at function level\n",
    "@patch('app.external_api.requests.get')\n",
    "def test_api_call(mock_get):\n",
    "    mock_get.return_value = MagicMock()\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Mock at fixture level\n",
    "@pytest.fixture\n",
    "def mock_db(self):\n",
    "    return MagicMock(spec=Session)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Override dependencies (FastAPI)\n",
    "app.dependency_overrides[get_weather_service] = lambda: mock_service\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Coverage\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microservices Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independent deployment**: Each service can be deployed separately\n",
    "2. **Technology diversity**: Different services can use different tech stacks\n",
    "3. **Organized around business capabilities**: Each service represents a domain\n",
    "4. **Decentralized data management**: Each service owns its database\n",
    "5. **Fault isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't crash entire system\n",
    "6. **Scalability**: Scale individual services based on demand\n",
    "\n",
    "### Service Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Synchronous Communication (REST/HTTP)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Weather Service API\n",
    "@app.get(\"/weather/{city}\")\n",
    "def get_weather(city: str):\n",
    "    return {\"city\": city, \"temperature\": 20}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Client calling Weather Service\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "response = requests.get(f\"http://weather-service/weather/{city}\")\n",
    "weather = response.json()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Simple and straightforward\n",
    "- Immediate response\n",
    "- Easy to debug\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- Tight coupling\n",
    "- Service dependency\n",
    "- Cascading failures possible\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Asynchronous Communication (Message Queues)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Producer (Weather Service)\n",
    "from celery import Celery\n",
    "celery = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379')\n",
    "\n",
    "@celery.task\n",
    "def process_weather_data(city):\n",
    "    # Process weather data\n",
    "    return {\"city\": city, \"status\": \"processed\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Consumer (Notification Service)\n",
    "@celery.task\n",
    "def send_weather_alert(weather_data):\n",
    "    # Send notification based on weather\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Loose coupling\n",
    "- Better fault tolerance\n",
    "- Natural load balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- Eventual consistency\n",
    "- More complex debugging\n",
    "- Message ordering challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Gateway Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "API Gateway acts as single entry point for all clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Responsibilities:**\n",
    "- Request routing\n",
    "- Authentication/Authorization\n",
    "- Rate limiting\n",
    "- Load balancing\n",
    "- Response transformation\n",
    "- Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with FastAPI:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# api_gateway.py\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\n",
    "import httpx\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "WEATHER_SERVICE = \"http://weather-service:8000\"\n",
    "USER_SERVICE = \"http://user-service:8001\"\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/api/weather/{city}\")\n",
    "async def get_weather(city: str, user_id: str):\n",
    "    # Verify user\n",
    "    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n",
    "        user_resp = await client.get(f\"{USER_SERVICE}/users/{user_id}\")\n",
    "        if user_resp.status_code != 200:\n",
    "            raise HTTPException(401, \"Unauthorized\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Get weather data\n",
    "        weather_resp = await client.get(f\"{WEATHER_SERVICE}/weather/{city}\")\n",
    "        return weather_resp.json()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Service Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Services need to find each other dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "- **Consul**: Service mesh with health checking\n",
    "- **Eureka**: Netflix's service registry\n",
    "- **Kubernetes DNS**: Built-in service discovery\n",
    "- **Environment variables**: Simple for small setups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database per Service Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Each microservice owns and manages its own database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Weather Service → PostgreSQL (weather_logs)\n",
    "User Service → PostgreSQL (users, sessions)\n",
    "Notification Service → Redis (message queue)\n",
    "Analytics Service → MongoDB (aggregated data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Service independence\n",
    "- Technology flexibility\n",
    "- Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "- Distributed transactions\n",
    "- Data consistency\n",
    "- Querying across services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Distributed Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saga Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Break transaction into sequence of local transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Order Saga Example\n",
    "class OrderSaga:\n",
    "    def create_order(self, order_data):\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            # Step 1: Reserve inventory\n",
    "            inventory_id = self.inventory_service.reserve(order_data)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # Step 2: Process payment\n",
    "            payment_id = self.payment_service.charge(order_data)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # Step 3: Create order\n",
    "            order_id = self.order_service.create(order_data)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            return {\"order_id\": order_id}\n",
    "        except Exception as e:\n",
    "            # Compensating transactions\n",
    "            self.inventory_service.release(inventory_id)\n",
    "            self.payment_service.refund(payment_id)\n",
    "            raise\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit Breaker Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevent cascading failures by detecting and handling failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from circuitbreaker import circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "@circuit(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=60)\n",
    "def call_weather_service(city):\n",
    "    response = requests.get(f\"http://weather-service/weather/{city}\")\n",
    "    response.raise_for_status()\n",
    "    return response.json()\n",
    "\n",
    "# If 5 failures occur, circuit opens\n",
    "# Requests fail fast for 60 seconds\n",
    "# Then attempts recovery\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monitoring and Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distributed Tracing\n",
    "Track requests across multiple services.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using OpenTelemetry\n",
    "from opentelemetry import trace\n",
    "\n",

    "    with tracer.start_as_current_span(\"get_weather\"):\n",
    "        with tracer.start_as_current_span(\"call_external_api\"):\n",
    "            result = api_client.get_current_weather(city)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        with tracer.start_as_current_span(\"save_to_db\"):\n",
    "            db.add(WeatherLog(**result))\n",
    "            db.commit()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Centralized Logging\n",
    "Aggregate logs from all services.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",

    "5. **Monitoring**: Observability from day one\n",
    "6. **Documentation**: Clear API contracts\n",
    "7. **Security**: Authentication at gateway, authorization per service\n",
    "8. **Data consistency**: Plan for eventual consistency\n",
    "9. **Deployment automation**: CI/CD is mandatory\n",
    "10. **Team structure**: Align teams with services (Conway's Law)\n",
