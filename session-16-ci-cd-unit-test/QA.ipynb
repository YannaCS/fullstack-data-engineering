    "**Unit tests** \n",
    "- verify **the smallest pieces of code in isolation**, typically single functions or classes.  \n",
    "- I use them to catch logic bugs early and ensure individual components behave correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integration tests** \n",
    "- check how **multiple components interact**\n",
    "- for example, testing a service layer that talks to the database or another API.\n",
    "- I use them to ensure **systems work together as expected**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**End-to-end tests** \n",
    "- simulate **real user flows** across the **entire system**: UI → API → database.\n",
    "- I use these carefully because they’re slower, but they ensure the full system behaves correctly in real-world scenarios.\n",

    "### **Explain the purpose of mocking in unit tests. What's the difference between Mock, MagicMock, and patch in Python's unittest.mock?**\n",
    "Mocking **isolates the unit being tested** by <u>replacing external dependencies</u>, like network calls, DB queries, or integrations, <u>with controllable fake objects</u>. It ensures tests are fast, deterministic, and focused on the logic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mock**: The **basic mock object**. You define expected behaviors or returned values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**MagicMock**: \n",
    "- **Extends Mock with default implementations** for Python “magic methods,” like `__len__`, `__iter__`, `__enter__`, etc. \n",
    "- Useful when mocking objects used in **context managers or operators**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**patch**: \n",
    "- A decorator or context manager that **temporarily replaces a module/class/function** during the test. \n",
    "- It’s **how we inject mocks into specific locations**.\n",

    "A common guideline is **80%+** coverage, but coverage alone doesn’t guarantee quality.  \n",
