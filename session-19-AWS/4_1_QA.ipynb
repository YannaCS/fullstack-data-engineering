    "\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 is object storage, not a file system, due to these fundamental differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | File System | S3 Object Storage |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Structure** | Hierarchical with directories, inodes | Flat namespace with key-value pairs |\n",
    "| **Operations** | Random read/write, seek, append | Only GET/PUT entire objects |\n",
    "| **Metadata** | Limited (permissions, timestamps) | Rich, custom metadata support |\n",
    "| **Modification** | In-place updates possible | Must replace entire object |\n",
    "| **Locking** | File locks supported | No native locking |\n",
    "| **Path** | Real directory traversal | \"Folders\" are just key prefixes |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point:** You cannot open a file in S3, seek to byte 1000, and modify 10 bytes. You must download the entire object, modify it locally, and upload the new version.\n",

    "### Q2: Explain the relationship between Bucket, Object, and Key in S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Amazon S3, a bucket is a top-level container, an object is the stored data inside bucket, and the key is the unique identifier that locates the object within the bucket. There is no real directories, only keys with prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1️. Bucket   \n",
    "  - A bucket is the top-level container in S3\n",
    "  - It lives in a single AWS Region\n",
    "  - Bucket names are globally unique\n",
    "  - Used for:\n",
    "    - Organizing data\n",
    "    - Applying policies (bucket policy, access points)\n",
    "    - Managing settings (versioning, lifecycle, encryption)\n",
    "\n",
    "  > 📦 Think of a bucket as a root namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "2️. Object  \n",
    "  - An object is the actual data stored in S3\n",
    "  - Each object consists of:\n",
    "    - Data (file contents)\n",
    "    - Metadata\n",
    "    - Key\n",
    "  - Objects are immutable (updates = new object)\n",
    "\n",
    "  > 📄 Objects are the units of storage\n",
    "\n",
    "3️. Key    \n",
    "  - A key is the unique identifier of an object within a bucket\n",
    "  - It is a string, not a real folder path\n",
    "  - “Folders” in S3 are logical, created by key prefixes\n",
    "\n",
    "  > 🔑 Key = object’s full path name\n",

    "### Q3: Why can't you update a single row inside a CSV file stored in S3?\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 is **immutable object storage**. When you store a CSV file, it becomes a single binary blob (object). S3 has no understanding of:\n",
    "- Row structure\n",
    "- CSV format\n",
    "- Line boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**To modify one row, you must:**\n",

    "2. Parse it locally (e.g., with pandas)\n",
    "3. Modify the specific row\n",
    "4. Upload the complete new file\n",
    "5. The new upload replaces the old object (or creates a new version)\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is why data lakes often use:**\n",
    "- **Parquet** format with partitioning for efficient updates\n",

    "### Q4: What is an S3 prefix, and why is it important for Spark/Hive performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **prefix** is the \"folder-like\" portion of an object key before the actual filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters for performance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Without Prefix Partitioning:\n",
    "Query: SELECT * FROM sales WHERE date = '2024-01-15'\n",
    "→ Spark must scan ALL files: s3://bucket/*.parquet\n",
    "→ Full table scan!\n",
    "\n",
    "With Prefix Partitioning:\n",
    "s3://bucket/year=2024/month=01/day=15/*.parquet\n",
    "Query: SELECT * FROM sales WHERE date = '2024-01-15'\n",
    "→ Spark only reads: s3://bucket/year=2024/month=01/day=15/\n",
    "→ Partition pruning! Only relevant data scanned.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Benefits:**\n",
    "1. **Partition Pruning**: Read only relevant \"directories\"\n",
    "2. **Parallelism**: Spark reads different prefixes in parallel\n",
    "3. **Reduced I/O**: Less data transferred from S3\n",
    "4. **Cost Savings**: Fewer S3 GET requests\n"
