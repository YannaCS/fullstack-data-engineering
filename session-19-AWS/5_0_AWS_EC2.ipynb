    "# Scaling Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling is the process of adjusting compute capacity to meet demand. There are two fundamental approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vertical Scaling (Scale Up / Scale Down)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Increase or decrease the CPU/memory of a **single** EC2 instance by changing its instance type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it Works:\n",
    "```\n",
    "t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM)\n",
    "           ↓\n",
    "    Stop instance\n",
    "           ↓\n",
    "  Change instance type\n",
    "           ↓\n",
    "m5.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Stop the instance** (cannot change type while running)\n",
    "2. **Change instance type** via console or CLI\n",
    "3. **Start the instance** with new capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics:\n",
    "- ✅ **Simple to implement** - just change instance type\n",
    "- ✅ **No application changes** needed\n",
    "- ❌ **Downtime required** during the change\n",
    "- ❌ **Limited by maximum instance size** (finite ceiling)\n",
    "- ❌ **Single point of failure** (not fault-tolerant)\n",
    "- ❌ **Cannot scale beyond largest instance type**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Use Cases:\n",
    "- Development/test environments\n",
    "- Applications that cannot be distributed\n",
    "- Databases (traditional RDBMS)\n",
    "- Legacy applications\n",
    "- Quick performance boost\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Stop instance\n",
    "aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-xxxxxxxxx\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for stopped state\n",
    "aws ec2 wait instance-stopped --instance-ids i-xxxxxxxxx\n",
    "\n",
    "# Change instance type\n",
    "aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \\\n",
    "  --instance-id i-xxxxxxxxx \\\n",
    "  --instance-type \"{Value: m5.2xlarge}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start instance\n",
    "aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-xxxxxxxxx\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out / Scale In)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Add or remove **multiple** EC2 instances to handle load by distributing work across many machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it Works:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Single Instance\n",
    "     ↓\n",
    "Add more instances\n",
    "     ↓\n",
    "3 Instances (cluster)\n",
    "     ↓\n",
    "Add more instances\n",
    "     ↓\n",
    "10 Instances (cluster)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics:\n",
    "- ✅ **High availability** - failure of one instance doesn't break system\n",
    "- ✅ **Fault tolerance** - work redistributed on failure\n",
    "- ✅ **No downtime** during scaling\n",
    "- ✅ **Virtually unlimited scaling** - add as many instances as needed\n",
    "- ✅ **Better cost optimization** - add/remove as needed\n",
    "- ❌ **More complex** - requires load balancing and coordination\n",
    "- ❌ **Application must support** distributed architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components Needed:\n",
    "1. **Load Balancer** - Distributes traffic across instances\n",
    "2. **Auto Scaling Group** - Automatically adds/removes instances\n",
    "3. **Cluster Manager** - Coordinates distributed work (e.g., YARN, Kubernetes)\n",
    "4. **Shared Storage** - S3, EFS, or HDFS for data access\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Use Cases:\n",
    "- **Web applications** - handle variable traffic\n",
    "- **Microservices** - independent scaling of services\n",
    "- **Big data processing** - Hadoop, Spark clusters\n",
    "- **Containerized applications** - ECS, EKS\n",
    "- **Stateless applications** - no local state dependency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Used By:\n",
    "- ✅ **Amazon EMR** - Managed Hadoop/Spark clusters\n",
    "- ✅ **Amazon ECS/EKS** - Container orchestration\n",
    "- ✅ **Spark clusters** - Distributed data processing\n",
    "- ✅ **Hadoop clusters** - Distributed storage and compute\n",
    "- ✅ **Web application clusters** - Behind load balancers\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Use Vertical Scaling When:\n",
    "- Application cannot be distributed\n",
    "- Need quick performance improvement\n",
    "- Simple architecture preferred\n",
    "- Temporary capacity increase\n",
    "- Development/testing\n",

    "### Hybrid Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many systems use **both strategies**:\n",
    "1. **Vertically scale** to right-size individual instances\n",
    "2. **Horizontally scale** by adding more optimally-sized instances\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \n",
    "- Start with m5.xlarge instances\n",
    "- Horizontal scale: 5 instances → 10 instances (for more traffic)\n",
    "- Vertical scale: m5.xlarge → m5.2xlarge (if each instance needs more power)\n",

    "#### Basic Principle:\n",
    "- **Multiple EC2 instances form a cluster**\n",
    "- Each instance plays a specific role\n",
    "- Instances work together as a coordinated system\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instance Roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Master / Driver / Coordinator**\n",
    "   - Controls and coordinates the cluster\n",
    "   - Distributes tasks to workers\n",
    "   - Monitors cluster health\n",
    "   - Examples:\n",
    "     - Hadoop NameNode\n",
    "     - Spark Driver\n",
    "     - Kubernetes Master Node\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Worker / Executor / Slave**\n",
    "   - Executes assigned tasks\n",
    "   - Processes data\n",
    "   - Reports back to master\n",
    "   - Examples:\n",
    "     - Hadoop DataNode\n",
    "     - Spark Executor\n",
    "     - Kubernetes Worker Node\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Clusters Are Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data is Too Large for a Single Machine\n",
    "- **Problem**: 100 TB dataset won't fit on one machine\n",
    "- **Solution**: Distribute data across many machines\n",
    "- **Example**: HDFS splits data into blocks across DataNodes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Workload Can Be Parallelized\n",
    "- **Problem**: Processing takes too long on one machine\n",
    "- **Solution**: Divide work among many machines\n",
    "- **Example**: Spark distributes transformations across executors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Failures Are Expected and Handled\n",
    "- **Problem**: Hardware failures are inevitable at scale\n",
    "- **Solution**: Replication and fault tolerance\n",

    "### Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is EMR?**\n",
    "- **Managed Hadoop/Spark service** on AWS\n",
    "- Automatically provisions and configures EC2 clusters\n",
    "- Formula: **EMR = EC2 + Cluster Manager + Hadoop/Spark**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EMR Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **EC2 Instances**\n",
    "   - Physical compute resources\n",
    "   - You choose instance types\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cluster Manager**\n",
    "   - AWS manages cluster lifecycle\n",
    "   - Handles instance failures\n",
    "   - Scales cluster automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Big Data Frameworks**\n",
    "   - Pre-installed Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Presto\n",
    "   - Configured and optimized by AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EMR Cluster Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Node** (formerly Master):\n",
    "- m5.xlarge\n",
    "- Runs NameNode, ResourceManager\n",
    "- Coordinates cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Nodes**:\n",
    "- m5.xlarge, r5.xlarge\n",
    "- Run DataNode, NodeManager\n",
    "- Store HDFS data\n",
    "- Cannot be removed without data loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Nodes** (optional):\n",
    "- c5.xlarge\n",
    "- Run NodeManager only\n",
    "- No HDFS storage\n",
    "- Can be added/removed (Spot instances work well)\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS Glue (Serverless Alternative)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Glue?**\n",
    "- **Serverless ETL service**\n",
    "- No EC2 management required\n",
    "- AWS provisions resources automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Glue vs EMR:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | EMR (EC2-based) | Glue (Serverless) |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **EC2 Management** | You manage | AWS manages |\n",
    "| **Cluster Setup** | Manual | Automatic |\n",
    "| **Scaling** | Manual/Auto-scaling | Fully automatic |\n",
    "| **Cost** | Pay for instances | Pay per job |\n",
    "| **Control** | Full control | Limited control |\n",
    "| **Best For** | Complex clusters | Simple ETL jobs |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other EC2 Cluster Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Apache Airflow\n",
    "- **Orchestration tool** for data pipelines\n",
    "- **Scheduler Node**: EC2 instance running Airflow scheduler\n",
    "- **Web Server Node**: EC2 instance for Airflow UI\n",
    "- **Worker Nodes**: EC2 instances executing tasks\n",
    "- **Database**: RDS or EC2 with PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Kubernetes on EC2 (Amazon EKS)\n",
    "- **Control Plane**: Managed by AWS (or on EC2)\n",
    "- **Worker Nodes**: EC2 instances running containers\n",
    "- **Pods**: Containerized applications\n",
    "- Horizontal scaling via adding EC2 worker nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Cassandra Cluster\n",
    "- **Multiple EC2 nodes** (no single master)\n",
    "- **Instance type**: i3.2xlarge (storage optimized)\n",
    "- **Replication**: Data copied across nodes\n",
    "- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **EC2 provides the infrastructure** - it's the foundation\n",
    "2. **Software frameworks** (Hadoop, Spark) run on top of EC2\n",
    "3. **Clusters distribute work** across multiple EC2 instances\n",
    "4. **Each instance has a role** (master/worker)\n",
    "5. **Managed services** (EMR, EKS) automate EC2 cluster management\n",
    "6. **Serverless alternatives** (Glue) eliminate EC2 management entirely\n",
